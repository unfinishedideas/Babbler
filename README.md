## A Simple Chat Application that uses Web Sockets

### Why?

Everyone has to make a chat application right? I wanted to see how web sockets worked using SignalR and also wanted to learn how to connect a C# backend to a React front end.

### Resources

Pretty much all of this was taken from [Mohamad Lawand's video on the subject.](https://youtu.be/pvi_ZS_PrSc?si=2g2Z-53UvlWAhHtV)
